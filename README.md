*************THIS PROJECT IS VIBE CODED USING CHATGPT**********************

-
youShallNotPass! is a TWINE made to teach kids (about grade 4 age) very basic cybersecurity things.
-

-
The original version relied on an instructor to teach and walk the kids through it and give them the needed shortcuts/passcodes. If you download and open the .html file in the dev folder, all of the tips and trick are written within the twine.
-

-
To view the html, CSS, and JS you can use the web browser editor at https://twinery.org/
You will need to click 'Library' then 'import' and bring in the .twee file in dev. From there it is quite simple to go through the nodes.
